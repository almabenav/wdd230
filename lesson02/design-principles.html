            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

                <p>Maaemo</p>

                <p>Maaemo is a restaurant site, in its four corners you can see the necessary options in its interface (information, reservations, gift cards and contact) without cluttering the page. So the user can find the option he is looking for very easily, which is exactly what hick's law teaches us: the fewer options, the easier it is for the user to make decisions and the faster he can make decisions.</p>

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <div class="card-info">
                <p>Envoulve</p>
                <a href="http://evoulve.com/">envoulve.com</a>

                </picture>
                <p>The contrast that exists in this page seems incredible to me, at the top you can see two colors that despite being striking together look very good and make the page look very stylish with a futuristic touch, as you go down the page you can see how they change their colors in contrast making the experience much more enjoyable and not boring at all. You can see how they change three times and their contrast is still very good.</p>

            <h3>Clean Design</h3>
            <div class="card-info">
                <p>Leenheyne</p>
                <a href="https://leenheyne.nl/home">leenheyne.nl/home</a>

                </picture>   
                <p>Leen Heyne's monochrome logo and company name are the only significant visual elements on its homepage. The surrounding expanse of white space makes it a safe bet that the user's eyes will be drawn to the products, and the clean design makes it look much more elegant. It's a clear example of a minimalist homepage, personally my favorite design style.</p>
